# Using Sublime Text with RESTer plugin to access TestLink REST API
The files present in this folder are examples that can be run inside  
the Sublime Text editor using https://github.com/pjdietz/rester-sublime-http-client  

This can be a good approach to involve the developers in test case design 
allowing them to write simple tests without leaving the editor.
